Heâ€™s super productive, he independently implemented multiple UI workflows for a large product launch in a short time. I was impressed by the care he showed for launching with a well tested product with good UX. I think any team would be lucky to have Nikhil as an engineer."

He played an important role in a large product launching under tight timelines and it would not have been possible without his great work. Thank you, Nikhil!"

He took over the ownership of the entire UI workstream for our new tracking product halfway through when the previous engineer leading it left. After taking this over, he completed work ahead of schedule, helped another engineer ramp up on the project, thoroughly tested it, fixed all the high priority bugs and implemented dozens of last-minute design changes ahead of release."
